### Instructions

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items

* the most common fish, 

* the rarest fish

* the total number of fish

AND

 include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a title giving the total number of fish caught.  Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.

Create an Rmarkdown to demonstrate the use of your function with fish.txt

REVIEW - creating_packages.RMD (in Section for March 3)

```{r}

fish <- read_csv(here::here("assignments", "assignment4", "fish.txt"))
