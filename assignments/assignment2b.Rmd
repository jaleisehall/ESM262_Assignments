##Calculating power
#Contract:
*Input*: vehicle mass in kg (m), vehicle speed in m/s (V)
*Output*: power in watts (Pb)
*Parameters*: c_rolling (rolling coefficient), g (acceleration due to gravity), A (surface area of vehicle), p_air (air density), and c_drag (aerodynamic resistive coefficient)

#What will the function do?
Compute the power required to keep a car moving at a given speed, as a proxy for automobile fuel efficiency, using the following equation - *body* of the function
$Pb = c_rolling * m * g * V + Â½ * A *p_air * c_drag * V^3$
Pb is power in watts, c_rolling is a rolling coefficient, m is vehicle mass in kg, g is acceleration due to gravity, V is vehicle speed in m/s, A is surface area of vehicle in m^2, p_air is air density, and c_drag is an aerodynamic resistive coefficient. 
#Typical values for:
c_rolling = 0.015
c_drag = 0.3
g = 9.8 m/s^2
A = 9 m^2  
p_air = 1.2 mg/m^3


```{r}
#Create car power function
car_fuel_eff = function(m, V, c_rolling = 0.015,  g = 9.8, A = 9, p_air = 1.2, c_drag = 0.3) {
  result =  c_rolling * m * g * V + 0.5 * A *p_air * c_drag * V^3
  return(result) 
}
```

#Compute power given:
m = 31752 kg 
range of vehicle speeds (30 m/s, 80 km/hr, 120 km/hr, 40 km/hr )
Unit conversions: km/hr to m/s, 1 km = 1000m, 1 hr = 3600 s, 1 km/hr = 0.277778 m/s

```{r}
#Create conversion factor for speeds in km/hr
kmhr_ms_conv = 0.2778

#Compute power given range of vehicle speeds
power_30 = car_fuel_eff(m=31752, V=30)

# Our highway

2 car types 

Imagine with have 3 different car types - and we know how often each occurs:

* car A  mass 31752 kg, area 9 m^2^

* car B mass 30000 kg, area 10 m^2^

Mean highway speed is 120 km/hr 

```{r}

# generate a structure to store info on our possible cars
possible_cars = data.frame(name = c("A","B"),mass=c(31752,30000), area = c(9,10))

# first look at how results vary for mean speed say 100km/hr
# do conversion
speed_base = 120 * kmhr_ms_conv

# because I have one mass and area for each car and only 1 speed
# I can estimate power for each car type
# add to the data structure
possible_cars$power = car_fuel_eff(V=speed_base, A = possible_cars$area, m=possible_cars$mass)

# Building a highway

What could be the total power consumed if there are 100 cars on this highway each hour,
they are travelling at a range of speeds - mean is 100km/hr and speeds tend to
be log-normally distributed)

How would the total power consumed vary by car
So if all cars are car A; OR all cars are car B OR all cars are car C

We will use *sample* here to generate speeds for our 100 cars and look at different ways to
repeat power calculation for different cars

* repeating by hand
* *pmap* for repetition - a efficient way of looping in R
* *for* for repetition - a more standard way of looping available in many langugaes

# First lets do it 'by hand'

```{r}

# what is I want to estimate average power use given  each car

# use sample to generate a distribution of speeds

# assume a log normal distribution of speeds with mean 100km/hr

# lets get a sample of a 200 speeds- we could also do this by actually measuring speeds
